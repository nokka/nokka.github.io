Hello I'm Stefan and I'm a software engineer from Stockholm, Sweden. I write software mainly in
Go for micro services / API development and infrastructure. I am a Diablo II enthusiast and have
written several tools for the Diablo II open source community in my spare time.

I consider myself a backender but I enjoy frontend as well, mostly react.js the last few years but I've also worked
with native mobile apps.

Companies have trusted me to help them write software in everything from PHP, Javascript, C#, Swift,
and Go. They have also trusted me to lead their development teams as a tech lead.
