Being a Software Engineer served me well for many years. My role was to listen,
ask questions and learn as much as I could about the domain,
then ultimately describe the business as code so that a machine
could understand them and other humans could reason about and extend them.

I did this happily for over ten years but then one day I was asked by a tech manager
to lead a new team that was going to scale the company I was working for to multiple
new markets in Europe. I had never given it much thought before, being a technical leader.

I had worked in small teams where I had been exploring new programming languages, sharing my findings in smaller groups or even individually to people
who trusted me. I thought to myself, being a good tech lead can't possibly be any different from what I'm already doing?

I accepted the role with this in mind feeling empowered but in hindsight I got almost everything wrong and I think it's a common mistake
for engineers to make who move into a leadership position without any guidance. I was 29 years old at the time and this single decision
set me off on a completely new direction in life.

I had never worked in a team with a defined tech lead role and I had this idea in my head of a tech
lead being the most experienced coder in the team, being able to solve any issue and of course commit
more code than any other individual contributor.

We were forming the new team and had a team activity where we wrote expectations on the different roles in the 
team as a way to align. I literally wrote "Codes a lot" on the tech lead post-it, that's it.
I can't remember a single thing anyone else wrote (Thanks brain).

So I got to work, I wrote code, worked on team foundations and documentation, helped developers, attended product meetings,
helped product owners with sprint planning and of course stakeholders had already set a deadline 
before the project had even started (No we didn't make it, not even close).

Suddenly I found my calendar full of meetings, people just kept inviting me to everything and since 
I had no idea what was expected of me, I just joined all of them and tried to make sense of all these
contexts. This feeling began to creep up on me that I was failing miserably, because remember my only
expectation on a tech lead was "Codes a lot" and I did no coding at all by now.

This went on for quite a while and I lost more and more confidence, I felt like I was losing my technical
skills since I did nothing technical anymore. All I did was unblock others, attend endless meetings
 and feel anxious about not contributing to the code.

I felt as if my strengths weren't being valued and 
I started question myself and became closed off. Nothing felt meaningful or important and when we finally 
launched our new product I felt nothing - absolutely nothing.

My self doubt and anxiety got me interested in psychology, leadership and spirituality. I started reading a lot of books
hoping to find some answers on how to deal with my feelings. I started to realise that healthy technical leadership isn't about who writes the most code or about technical savvy. It's
about humans, about gratitude and being an empathic listener who moves the team forward by helping the team reach clarity.

I've summarized a few key principles that I got wrong from the start, that took me years to develop and that I would like to share
to guide anyone who is trying to figure out how they might want to lead.

### Stay true to your own temperament
It doesn't matter if you love the spotlight and want to impact your
organisation by giving talks or if you prefer teaching, mentoring or writing. We're all
different and technical organisations can thrive with more than one leadership archetype.

I'm on the more introverted side of things. Meetings, social activities or public speaking drain my energy and cause anxiety, but as a new Tech lead
I was told by management to be more extroverted, to high five team members daily (yes this actually happened). I was expected
to do all kinds of things that was basically other peoples view of what a leader was. All the things I valued and thought was important
got implicitly shoved aside as less important.

This didn't sit right with me and in my reserach I found this book called [Quiet](https://www.amazon.com/Quiet-Power-Introverts-World-Talking/dp/0307352153) by Susan Cain
that focuses on how society often missunderstands and undervalues traits by introverted people
that can lead to them changing their personality in the workplace to fit in, which in turn leads to a huge waste of talent, energy and happiness.

This book helped me realise there are more than one type of leader and that I had spent years not staying true to my own temperament and 
that it had caused me a lot of suffering.

Don't get me wrong, challenging fears and trying new things is instrumental to growth, but
it needs to come from a place of curiosity, if you think a new skill or overcoming a fear can help you grow then challenge yourself.
If the anxiety tells you no, then it's probably an even better idea to do it, but don't let anyone else define what is important to you.

> "In the long run staying true to your temperament is key to finding work you love and work that matters" - Susan Cain

If you don't stay true to how you feel and start to change your behavious to fit expectations set by others, then you will
slowly lose track of what's important to you. Introverted people are more often overlooked for leadership positions because society 
tend to favor extroverted people who are comfortable in the spotlight and prefer action taking over contemplation. Susan Cain gives
this great TED talk about the power of introverts that is truly inspiring.

Different people require different support. In meetings, there's usually loud people, who share their thoughts, write on whiteboards, and then you have more quiet 
people who don't neccesarily contributes on these sessions but they might have equally good ideas. Take note
of these people and reach out to them and ask how they would like to contribute, maybe they will write
a great proposal and share with the team given the chance or maybe they aren't comfortable sharing their ideas
and then you can share the ideas with the team and make sure to give credit to the author.

As Susan Cain mention in the TED talk linked above:

> There is zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas.

### Being a tribal leader
Every organization is composed of small tribes, either by explicit teams or naturally occuring groups of people. 
What makes some tribes more effective than others is their culture, their language and their sense of purpose.

Being a tribal leader is about leveraging these tribes, often your team or adjacent teams on a common project
to rally behind a cause and doing so by creating a culture of belonging where people feel valued and safe to 
speak up and share their ideas. To change a culture of low trust where everyone is protecting themselves, 
their own interests and even gatekeeping information to stay relevant can be incredibly challenging and sometimes
finding a company with a culture that aligns with your values can be better in the long run.
Otherwise you will fight the culture every step of the way and people who are playing status games will make sure to put you down
to benefit their own interests. 

As a tech lead I found the tribal leadership philosophy incredibly useful. Usually as a tech lead you don't have
the team reporting to you in an organisational sense, but instead you are a part of the team with certain expectations
to lead the technical work.

This puts you in a unique position to build trust with the team, help people grow and overcome obstacles while
also having a huge impact on the culture and langauge used. The best part is that you can do this without having any organisational "power".
You can't force a team to adopt change, but you can lead with example, express graditute towards the people in your team and 
focus on growing people and their ideas. Try and learn the values, struggles and aspirations of everyone in your tribe. Help grow as
many people on your team as possible and the team will be rewarded with loyalty, productivity and innovation.

### Gratitude
Towards yourself, but definitely leading with gratitude

&nbsp;

### Building great software is a team sport
This is where I think I got it completely wrong as I moved into a technical leadership position. My naive idea of a great Tech lead
was someone who coded more than any other individual contributor and solved all problems. In reality it was my
role to enable the team, to amplify their output by supporting people, creating clarity and communicate the problems we were
experiencing to other people outside of the team.

As a tech lead, you have the opportunity to support, mentor and help others
become senior developers. As you help more and more people, the stronger the team grows and in turn the better software the team will produce.
If you help build a team culture of support and inclusion, your efforts will compound over time. Spend a lot of time helping others and
don't think so much about the fact that you didn't have time to write any code.

&nbsp;

### Reaching clarity
Learning to communicate well can be a great tool to help your  team reach clarity. Being able to communicate technical problems to people outside of tech will help the rest of the organisation understand
the difficulties and struggles the team might have. Being able to communicate to your team on why a certain business decision
was made might help the team reach clarity and more gracefully accept change.

Sometimes engineers resist change and stakeholders might fail to understand why we need to tackle technical debt for example, this is usually
because their goals don't align. Both parties want to build a great product but their vision of how to get there might be very different. 
Helping the organisation reach clarity in these situations can have a huge impact.

&nbsp;

### Closing thoughts
Different companies have different needs, find a company that shares your values and find work that makes you happy. Don't attach your whole identity to being a leader, you are still a coder and you will have
time to be a coder later in your career if you choose to. If you find leadership interesting, give it a chance, but do so
without obsessing over all the code you didn't write, do it because you want to have a bigger impact and enjoy helping people.
