I've always been able to maintain great relationships in the workplace, mostly
by listening more often than I speak and by being an intermediary in conflict (Explain cost of energy)

This served me well for many years as a Software Engineer. My role was to listen,
ask questions and learn as much as I could about the domain I was currently working in,
then ultimately write some code to describe these business rules so that a machine
could understand them.

I did this happily for over 10 years but then one day I was asked by a tech manager
to lead a new team that was going to scale the company I was working in to multiple
new markets in Europe. I had never given it much thought before, being a technical leader.

I had worked in small teams where I had in my own mind assumed the role of a
"leader" by exploring new programming languages, ways of working and setting the 
team practices by sharing my thoughts often in smaller groups or even individually to people
who trusted me.

I accepted the role with this in mind feeling empowered and proud of how amazing I was, oh boy was I naive.
I was 29 years old at the time and this single decision set me off on a completely new direction in life.

I had never worked in a team with a defined tech lead role and I had this idea in my head of a tech
lead being the most competent coder in the team, being able to solve any issue and of course commit
more code than any other individual contributor.

We were forming the new team and had a team activity where we wrote expectations on the roles in the 
teams as a way to align. I literally wrote "Codes a lot" on the tech lead post-it, that's it.
I can't remember a single thing anyone else wrote (Thanks brain).

So I got to work, I wrote code, worked on team foundations and documentation, helped developers, attended product meetings,
helped product owners with sprint planning and of course stakeholders had already set a deadline 
before the project had even started (No we didn't make it, not even close).

Suddenly I found my calendar full of meetings, people just kept inviting me to everything and since 
I had no idea what was expected of me, I just joined all of them and tried to make sense of all these
contexts. This feeling began to creep up on me that I was failing miserably, because remember my only
expectation on a tech lead was "Codes a lot" and I did no coding at all by now.

This went on for quite a while and I lost more and more confidence, I felt like I was losing my technical
skills since I did nothing technical anymore, right? All I did was unblock others, attend meetings, tried
to get the product organisation to understand our domain and feel anxious about not contributing to the code.

A tech manager at a more mature tech company might have caught this behaviour early and offered support by
sharing resources, experiences and thoughts. I didn't have any of this unfortunately and most of the feedback
I got from management was that I needed to be more visibly cheer-y and maybe even high five team members from time to time.

This work environment started to seriously affect my health by now, I felt as if my strengths weren't being valued and 
I started to question my competence and became closed off. Nothing felt meaningful or important and when we finally 
launched our new product I felt nothing - absolutely nothing.

My self doubt and anxiety got me interested in psychology, leadership and spirituality. I started reading a lot of books
hoping to find some answers on how to deal with my situation. (I'll link a few books in the end).

I started to realise that healthy leadership isn't about who writes the most code or about technical savvy. It's
about humans, about gratitude and being an empathic listener. 

One book in particular by Susan Cain called Quiet talked about how the world desperately need more introverted leaders.
People who prefer listening to speaking, who dislike self promotion 

### 1. Stay true to your temperament (nature)

{{< youtube c0KYU2j0TM4 >}}


I cannot stress this enough. This applies to everyone, it doesn't matter if you love the spotlight and feel energized
after social activites or if you feel like you need to recover energy alone, read a book or go for a walk in nature.

If you don't stay true to how you feel and start to change your behavious to fit expectations set by others, then you will
slowly give up parts of yourself. Introverted people are more often overlooked for leadership positions because society 
tend to favor extroverted people who are gregarious, comfortable in the spotlight and prefer action taking over contemplation. 

In the long run staying true to your temperament is key to finding work you love and work that matters


- Define your own role
Otherwise others will define it for you, no one sees the whole picture but you


2. Tribal leadership


3. Gratitude
Towards yourself, but definitely leading with gratitude

4. Find a company that shares your values
Otherwise you will fight the culture every step of the way and people who are playing a status
game will make sure to put you down


5. Building great software is a team sport
And it's your role to enable that team, amplify the output by supporting people

6. Reaching clarity
What looks like resistance is often a lack of clarity and learning to communicate well can be a great tool to reach clarity.

Being able to communicate technical problems to non-technical people will help the rest of the organisation to understand
the difficulties and struggles the team might have. While being able to communicate on why a certain business decision
was made will help the team reach clarity and more gracefully accept change.

7. Different people require different support
In meetings, usually loud people, who share their thoughts, write on whiteboards, and then you have more quiet 
people who don't neccesarily contributes on these sessions but they might have equally good ideas. Take note
of these people and reach out to them and ask how they would like to contribute, maybe they will write
a great proposal and share with the team given the chance or maybe they aren't comfortable sharing their ideas
and then you can share them with the team and make sure to give credit to the right person.

As Susan Cain mention in the TED talk linked above

> There is zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas.

Conclusion:
Different companies have different needs, find a company that shares your values
